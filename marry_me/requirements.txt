pydantic - Python library for data validation and parsing using type hints.
     describe the shape of your data with types, and Pydantic checks that inputs match and converts them when possible.

priority queue - is a special type of queue where each item has a priority, and items are removed based on their priority 
     - not just the order they were added.

Event-driven programming - a programming style where the flow of the program is controlled by events instead of a fixed sequence of instructions.

discrete event simulation (DES) - is a way of modeling a system where changes only happen at specific points in time, called events.
        Instead of continuously updating everything (like in physics simulations), the system “jumps” from one event to the next.
